All examples are shown in the R programming language and are demonstrated at the example of the iris dataset (4 continuous and 1 nominal variables). We demonstrate a) how to apply the algorithms on classification tasks (response = nominal, three species) and how to generate class specific (quasi) probability predictions and b) how to apply the algorithms to regression tasks (response = continuous) and make continuous predictions.\n\n\n\n",
